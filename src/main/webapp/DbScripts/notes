    The ServletContext lives for as long as the web app lives. It is shared among all requests in all sessions.
   
    The HttpSession lives for as long as the client is interacting with the web app with the same browser instance, and the session hasn't timed out
     at the server side. It is shared among all requests in the same session.
    
    The HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse live from the time the servlet receives an HTTP request from the client, until the complete response
     (the web page) has arrived. It is not shared elsewhere.
    
    All Servlet, Filter and Listener instances live as long as the web app lives. They are shared among all requests in all sessions.
    
    Any attribute that is defined in ServletContext, HttpServletRequest and HttpSession will live as long as the object in question lives. 
    The object itself represents the "scope" in bean management frameworks such as JSF, CDI, Spring, etc. Those frameworks store their 
    scoped beans as an attribute of its closest matching scope.
